I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to everyone who contributed to the development of this innovative generative AI-based chatbot. This project would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts and support of many individuals, and I would like to take this moment to acknowledge their invaluable contributions.

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the developers of the open-source tools and packages that formed the foundation of this project. The Llama and GPT4ALL tools provided the essential building blocks upon which this chatbot was constructed, and I am thankful for the contributions of the open-source community that made these tools available.

Additionally, I would like to recognize and thank myself, Joe Sibi Mattathil, for my tireless efforts in integrating these tools and packages to create a powerful and user-friendly chatbot. It has been a challenging but rewarding journey, and I am proud to have been a part of this project.

I would also like to acknowledge the work of imartinez on the PrivateGPT framework https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT, which served as the inspiration for the backend of my app. Building upon this framework, I was able to refine and enhance the chatbot's capabilities, providing users with a more efficient and interactive experience.


In conclusion, the development of this generative AI-based chatbot has been a collaborative effort, and I am grateful to everyone who played a part in bringing this project to life. This chatbot represents a significant advancement in AI technology, and I look forward to its continued growth and success.

Thank you all !
